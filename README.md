## Short-term

- [ ] don't allow empty submit--it creates a null item. HOW: need a validate function to call after grabbing form inputs. is validate built into browser as a function?
- [ ] Form validations in js:

  - Field type
  - What if a field left blank
  - What if only 1 actor or 1 genre
  - How is rating value entered
  - Extra spaces
  - Spelling?
- [ ] border around entire genre section?
- validate how? if each item in movie object is empty ?
- [ ] Check if new movie should be featured
- [ ] Featured image sizing
- [ ] DRY
  - Splits
- [ ] Optimal placement of renderNewMovie(newMovie)?
- [ ] why does add movie alert show up before render?
